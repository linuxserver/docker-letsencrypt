## Usage

```
docker create \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  --name=letsencrypt \
  -v <path to data>:/config \
  -e PGID=<gid> -e PUID=<uid>  \
  -e EMAIL=<email> \
  -e URL=<url> \
  -e SUBDOMAINS=<subdomains> \
  -e VALIDATION=<method> \
  -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  -e TZ=<timezone> \
  linuxserver/letsencrypt
```

## Parameters

`The parameters are split into two halves, separated by a colon, the left hand side representing the host and the right the container side. 
For example with a port -p external:internal - what this shows is the port mapping from internal to external of the container.
So -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080
http://192.168.x.x:8080 would show you what's running INSIDE the container on port 80.`


* `-p 80 -p 443` - the port(s)
* `-v /config` - all the config files including the webroot reside here
* `-e URL` - the top url you have control over ("customdomain.com" if you own it, or "customsubdomain.ddnsprovider.com" if dynamic dns)
* `-e SUBDOMAINS` - subdomains you'd like the cert to cover (comma separated, no spaces) ie. `www,ftp,cloud`. For a wildcard cert, set this _exactly_ to `wildcard` (wildcard cert is available via `dns` and `duckdns` validation only)
* `-e VALIDATION` - letsencrypt validation method to use, options are `http`, `tls-sni`, `dns` or `duckdns` (`dns` method also requires `DNSPLUGIN` variable set) (`duckdns` method requires `DUCKDNSTOKEN` variable set, and the `SUBDOMAINS` variable set to `wildcard`)
* `-e PGID` for GroupID - see below for explanation
* `-e PUID` for UserID - see below for explanation
* `-e TZ` - timezone ie. `America/New_York`  
  
_Optional settings:_
* `-e DNSPLUGIN` - required if `VALIDATION` is set to `dns`. Options are `cloudflare`, `cloudxns`, `digitalocean`, `dnsimple`, `dnsmadeeasy`, `google`, `luadns`, `nsone`, `rfc2136` and `route53`. Also need to enter the credentials into the corresponding ini file under `/config/dns-conf` 
* `-e DUCKDNSTOKEN` - required if `VALIDATION` is set to `duckdns`. Retrieve your token from https://www.duckdns.org
* `-e EMAIL` - your e-mail address for cert registration and notifications
* `-e DHLEVEL` - dhparams bit value (default=2048, can be set to `1024` or `4096`)
* `-p 80` - Port 80 forwarding is required when `VALIDATION` is set to `http`, but not `dns` or `tls-sni`
* `-e ONLY_SUBDOMAINS` - if you wish to get certs only for certain subdomains, but not the main domain (main domain may be hosted on another machine and cannot be validated), set this to `true`
* `-e EXTRA_DOMAINS` - additional fully qualified domain names (comma separated, no spaces) ie. `extradomain.com,subdomain.anotherdomain.org`
* `-e STAGING` - set to `true` to retrieve certs in staging mode. Rate limits will be much higher, but the resulting cert will not pass the browser's security test. Only to be used for testing purposes.
* `-e HTTPVAL` - Deprecated, please use the `VALIDATION` parameter instead

_Important notice:_
* This image previously used tls-sni validation over port 443. However, due to a security vulnerability, letsencrypt disabled tls-sni validation: https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/2018-01-11-update-regarding-acme-tls-sni-and-shared-hosting-infrastructure/50188 If you are getting the following error in the log, that means you are attempting tls-sni authentication, which is disabled by the servers: `Client with the currently selected authenticator does not support any combination of challenges that will satisfy the CA.` Please set the `VALIDATION` parameter to either `http` or `dns` and follow the above directions to revalidate. 

It is based on alpine linux with s6 overlay, for shell access whilst the container is running do `docker exec -it letsencrypt /bin/bash`.

### User / Group Identifiers

Sometimes when using data volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work" â„¢.

In this instance `PUID=1001` and `PGID=1001`. To find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id <dockeruser>
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```

## Setting up the application

### Validation and initial setup
* Before running this container, make sure that the url and subdomains are properly forwarded to this container's host, and that port 443 (and/or 80) is not being used by another service on the host (NAS gui, another webserver, etc.).
* For `http` validation, port 80 on the internet side of the router should be forwarded to this container's port 80
* For `tls-sni` validation, port 443 on the internet side of the router should be forwarded to this container's port 443
* For `dns` validation, make sure to enter your credentials into the corresponding ini file under `/config/dns-conf`
  * Cloudflare provides free accounts for managing dns and is very easy to use with this image. Make sure that it is set up for "dns only" instead of "dns + proxy"
  * Google dns plugin is meant to be used with "Google Cloud DNS", a paid enterprise product, and not for "Google Domains DNS"
* For `duckdns` validation, set the `SUBDOMAINS` variable to `wildcard`, and set the `DUCKDNSTOKEN` variable with your duckdns token. Due to a limitation of duckdns, the resulting cert will only cover the sub-subdomains (ie. `*.yoursubdomain.duckdns.org`) but will not cover `yoursubdomain.duckdns.org`. Therefore, it is recommended to use a sub-subdomain like `www.yoursubdomain.duckdns.org` for subfolders. You can use our [duckdns image](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/duckdns/) to update your IP on duckdns.org. 
* `--cap-add=NET_ADMIN` is required for fail2ban to modify iptables
* If you need a dynamic dns provider, you can use the free provider duckdns.org where the `URL` will be `yoursubdomain.duckdns.org` and the `SUBDOMAINS` can be `www,ftp,cloud` with http validation, or `wildcard` with dns validation.
* After setup, navigate to `https://yourdomain.url` to access the default homepage
### Security and password protection
* The container detects changes to url and subdomains, revokes existing certs and generates new ones during start. It also detects changes to the DHLEVEL parameter and replaces the dhparams file.
* If you'd like to password protect your sites, you can use htpasswd. Run the following command on your host to generate the htpasswd file `docker exec -it letsencrypt htpasswd -c /config/nginx/.htpasswd <username>`
* You can add multiple user:pass to `.htpasswd`. For the first user, use the above command, for others, use the above command without the `-c` flag, as it will force deletion of the existing `.htpasswd` and creation of a new one
* You can also use ldap auth for security and access control. A sample, user configurable ldap.conf is provided, and it requires the separate image [linuxserver/ldap-auth](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/ldap-auth/) to communicate with an ldap server.
### Site config and reverse proxy
* The default site config resides at `/config/nginx/site-confs/default`. Feel free to modify this file, and you can add other conf files to this directory. However, if you delete the `default` file, a new default will be created on container start.
* Preset reverse proxy config files are added for popular apps. See the `_readme` file under `/config/nginx/proxy_confs` for instructions on how to enable them
* If you wish to hide your site from search engine crawlers, you may find it useful to add this configuration line to your site config, within the server block, above the line where ssl.conf is included
`add_header X-Robots-Tag "noindex, nofollow, nosnippet, noarchive";`
This will *ask* Google et al not to index and list your site. Be careful with this, as you will eventually be de-listed if you leave this line in on a site you wish to be present on search engines
### Using certs in other containers
* This container includes auto-generated pfx and private-fullchain-bundle pem certs that are needed by other apps like Emby and Znc. 
  * To use these certs in other containers, do either of the following:
  1. *(Easier)* Mount the letsencrypt config folder in other containers (ie. `-v /path-to-le-config:/le-ssl`) and in the other containers, use the cert location `/le-ssl/keys/letsencrypt/`
  2. *(More secure)* Mount the letsencrypt folder `etc/letsencrypt` that resides under `/config` in other containers (ie. `-v /path-to-le-config/etc/letsencrypt:/le-ssl`) and in the other containers, use the cert location `/le-ssl/live/<your.domain.url>/` (This is more secure because the first method shares the entire letsencrypt config folder with other containers, including the www files, whereas the second method only shares the ssl certs)
  * These certs include:
  1. `cert.pem`, `chain.pem`, `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem`, which are generated by letsencrypt and used by nginx and various other apps
  2. `privkey.pfx`, a format supported by Microsoft and commonly used by dotnet apps such as Emby Server (no password)
  3. `priv-fullchain-bundle.pem`, a pem cert that bundles the private key and the fullchain, used by apps like ZNC
### Using fail2ban
* This container includes fail2ban set up with 3 jails by default:
  1. nginx-http-auth
  2. nginx-badbots
  3. nginx-botsearch
* To enable or disable other jails, modify the file `/config/fail2ban/jail.local`
* To modify filters and actions, instead of editing the `.conf` files, create `.local` files with the same name and edit those because .conf files get overwritten when the actions and filters are updated. `.local` files will append whatever's in the `.conf` files (ie. `nginx-http-auth.conf` --> `nginx-http-auth.local`)
* You can check which jails are active via `docker exec -it letsencrypt fail2ban-client status`
* You can check the status of a specific jail via `docker exec -it letsencrypt fail2ban-client status <jail name>`
* You can unban an IP via `docker exec -it letsencrypt fail2ban-client set <jail name> unbanip <IP>`
* A list of commands can be found here: https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Commands
